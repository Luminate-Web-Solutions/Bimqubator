// Descriptions for each service
const descriptions = {
  "HVAC System Layouts": "Comprehensive HVAC system planning tailored for optimal indoor comfort and energy efficiency. Includes advanced ductwork layouts, load calculations, airflow balancing, system zoning, and equipment placement to ensure minimal energy consumption while maintaining consistent climate control across all building zones.",
  
  "Electrical Load & Lighting Design": "Strategic planning of electrical systems including panel scheduling, cable sizing, circuit layouts, and lighting design. Ensures adherence to local and international codes, promotes energy conservation through smart lighting layouts, and provides a safe and reliable power infrastructure for all building types.",
  
  "Fire Protection System Design": "Design of robust fire safety systems in line with NFPA and local codes. Includes placement of sprinklers, smoke detectors, fire alarms, emergency lighting, hydrants, and clear evacuation routes to ensure maximum occupant safety and regulatory compliance during fire incidents.",
  
  "Plumbing & Drainage Schematics": "Design of efficient plumbing networks for water supply, waste management, and rainwater harvesting. Includes detailed pipe sizing, slope calculation, fixture layouts, greywater reuse systems, and ensures full compliance with plumbing standards and building codes.",
  
  "Equipment Sizing & Duct Routing": "Precision sizing of HVAC equipment such as chillers, AHUs, and FCUs, along with optimized duct routing that minimizes pressure losses and noise. Ensures seamless installation, maintenance accessibility, and high system performance throughout the lifecycle of the building.",
  
  "BIM Modeling": "Creation of intelligent, data-rich 3D BIM models that incorporate architectural, structural, and MEP systems. Enhances project visualization, improves coordination among stakeholders, and supports accurate documentation and facility management.",
  
  "Clash Detection & Resolution": "Automated and manual identification of inter-system conflicts using BIM coordination tools. Provides detailed clash reports and resolution strategies, preventing rework, cost overruns, and construction delays by ensuring design accuracy before execution.",

  "4D Scheduling & 5D Cost Estimation": "Integrates construction sequencing (4D) and cost analysis (5D) into BIM models for improved planning and control. Enables project teams to visualize construction timelines, forecast budgets accurately, and make data-driven decisions for resource allocation.",
  
  "Coordination with Architects & Structural Teams": "Holistic collaboration with architectural and structural teams to ensure design coherence and avoid discrepancies. Facilitates efficient project execution by synchronizing design intent, load paths, and space planning across disciplines.",
  
  "Conceptual & Detailed Planning": "Transforms initial design ideas into comprehensive construction-ready plans. Covers zoning, space allocation, material specifications, compliance checks, and budgeting, laying the foundation for a successful project lifecycle from approval to completion.",
  
  "3D Renderings & Walkthroughs": "High-resolution visualizations that simulate real-world lighting, textures, and materials. Offers immersive walkthroughs and flythroughs that enhance client understanding, boost stakeholder engagement, and support design validation before implementation.",
  
  "Interior Layout Planning": "Strategic interior space design prioritizing ergonomics, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. Addresses furniture placement, lighting schemes, and circulation flows while aligning with the clientâ€™s branding and operational needs.",
  
  "Building Code Compliance": "Detailed review and integration of local, national, and international building codes within all design aspects. Prevents legal challenges, ensures user safety, and speeds up the approval process for construction permits.",
  
  "Structural Analysis & Load Calculation": "In-depth analysis of structural elements under dead, live, seismic, and wind loads using advanced software. Guarantees building safety, stability, and serviceability by optimizing structural members and ensuring code adherence.",
  
  "Steel & Concrete Detailing": "Precise detailing of structural steel and reinforced concrete elements. Includes fabrication drawings, bar bending schedules (BBS), and connection details that ensure constructability and reduce wastage during site execution.",
  
  "Reinforcement Detailing (RCC)": "Detailed design and layout of reinforcement bars in beams, slabs, columns, and foundations. Focuses on structural safety, crack control, and efficient use of steel in accordance with IS and international standards.",
  
  "Foundation Design & Earthquake Safety": "Design of shallow and deep foundation systems based on soil conditions, structural loads, and seismic activity. Incorporates earthquake-resilient features like base isolation, ductile detailing, and soil-structure interaction analysis for long-term safety and durability.",
